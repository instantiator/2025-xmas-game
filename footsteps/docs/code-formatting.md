# Code Formatting and Linting Setup

This document outlines the configuration for code formatting (Prettier) and code quality linting (ESLint) in this project. The goal is to ensure consistent code style across the repository and a seamless development experience in Visual Studio Code.

## Required VS Code Extensions

For the editor integration to work as described, you must have the following VS Code extensions installed:

1.  **ESLint** (`dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`): Integrates ESLint into VS Code, showing linting errors and warnings directly in the editor.
2.  **Prettier - Code formatter** (`prettier.prettier-vscode`): The official Prettier extension, used to format code.

## Tool Configuration

Our setup uses three main configuration files to make Prettier and ESLint work together harmoniously.

### 1. Prettier (`.prettierrc.json`)

This file defines our code style rules. It is the single source of truth for all formatting options.

**`footsteps/.prettierrc.json`:**

```json
{
  "printWidth": 120,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "useTabs": false
}
```

- `"printWidth": 120`: Sets the maximum line length to 120 characters.
- `"tabWidth": 2`: Sets the indentation width to 2 spaces.
- `"useTabs": false`: Ensures that spaces are used for indentation, not tabs.

### 2. ESLint (`eslint.config.js`)

ESLint is configured for code quality, but we also integrate Prettier into its workflow. This allows us to see formatting issues as linting warnings and fix them automatically.

**`footsteps/eslint.config.js`:**

```javascript
import js from "@eslint/js";
import reactHooks from "eslint-plugin-react-hooks";
import reactRefresh from "eslint-plugin-react-refresh";
import { defineConfig, globalIgnores } from "eslint/config";
import globals from "globals";
import tseslint from "typescript-eslint";
import eslintPluginPrettierRecommended from "eslint-plugin-prettier/recommended";

export default defineConfig([
  globalIgnores(["dist"]),
  {
    files: ["**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
    extends: [
      js.configs.recommended,
      tseslint.configs.recommended,
      reactHooks.configs.flat.recommended,
      reactRefresh.configs.vite,
    ],
    languageOptions: {
      ecmaVersion: 2020,
      globals: globals.browser,
    },
    rules: {
      "react-hooks/set-state-in-effect": "off",
      "@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any": "off",
      "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": "warn",
      "@typescript-eslint/indent": "off", // Explicitly disable indent rule to avoid conflict with Prettier
    },
  },
  eslintPluginPrettierRecommended,
  {
    rules: {
      "prettier/prettier": "warn", // Show Prettier issues as warnings, not errors
    },
  },
]);
```

- **Integration:** We use `eslint-plugin-prettier/recommended`. This configuration does two crucial things:
  1.  It enables `eslint-config-prettier`, which disables all ESLint stylistic rules (like `indent`, `quotes`, etc.) that could conflict with Prettier.
  2.  It enables `eslint-plugin-prettier`, which runs Prettier as an ESLint rule (`prettier/prettier`).
- **Rule Overrides:** We explicitly set `"@typescript-eslint/indent": "off"` to resolve a specific conflict and set `"prettier/prettier": "warn"` to make formatting issues appear as less-intrusive warnings.

### 3. VS Code Workspace Settings (`.vscode/settings.json`)

This file configures VS Code's behavior to automate formatting on save.

**`.vscode/settings.json`:**

```json
{
  "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    // ... existing color settings ...
  },
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "prettier.prettier-vscode",
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": "explicit"
  },
  "[markdown]": {
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "prettier.prettier-vscode"
  }
}
```

- **TypeScript/TSX Files:** For these files, two actions run on save in sequence:
  1.  `"editor.formatOnSave": true` runs first, using Prettier (`prettier.prettier-vscode`) to format the entire file.
  2.  `"editor.codeActionsOnSave"` runs immediately after, triggering ESLint to fix any remaining auto-fixable code quality issues.
- **Markdown Files:** We handle Markdown separately to avoid ESLint trying to parse it as code. The `"[markdown]"` block configures VS Code to use only the Prettier extension to format `.md` files on save.

## Troubleshooting Journey: Issues and Resolutions

Setting this up involved solving a few tricky problems.

### Problem 1: Formatting "Bouncing" on Save

- **Issue:** When saving a TypeScript file, the indentation would quickly change to 2 spaces (correct) and then immediately "bounce" back to 4 spaces (incorrect), especially for multi-line imports.
- **Diagnosis:** This indicated that two formatters were running in sequence. A diagnostic test confirmed that the Prettier extension alone worked correctly, meaning the conflict was coming from the ESLint "fix on save" action.
- **Resolution:** The root cause was an indentation rule from `@typescript-eslint` that was not being properly disabled by the Prettier configuration for import statements. We resolved this by explicitly disabling the rule in `eslint.config.js`:
  ```javascript
  "rules": {
    "@typescript-eslint/indent": "off"
  }
  ```

### Problem 2: Linting Errors in Markdown Files

- **Issue:** When we initially tried to format Markdown files by including them in `eslint.config.js`, ESLint threw parsing errors because it was attempting to lint Markdown content as if it were JavaScript.
- **Resolution:** We separated the concerns. We removed Markdown from ESLint's scope and configured VS Code to handle it independently. The `"[markdown]"` block in `.vscode/settings.json` tells the editor to use the Prettier extension directly for formatting `.md` files, bypassing ESLint entirely for this file type.

### Problem 3: Initial ESLint and Prettier Conflict

- **Issue:** At the start, ESLint and Prettier were not configured to work together, which would have led to them "fighting" over code style.
- **Resolution:** We installed `eslint-plugin-prettier` and `eslint-config-prettier` and added `eslint-plugin-prettier/recommended` to the ESLint configuration. This makes Prettier the single source of truth for formatting and integrates it smoothly into the ESLint workflow.

## How to Modify the Configuration

- **To change a formatting rule (e.g., line width, quotes):** Modify the `footsteps/.prettierrc.json` file. This is the single source of truth for all style options.
- **To change an ESLint code-quality rule:** Modify the `rules` object in `footsteps/eslint.config.js`.
