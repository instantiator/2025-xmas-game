# Christmas Game 2025

This game is built around `footsteps` - a puzzle-game building system.

Run locally: `npm run dev`
Build static pages: `npm run build`

There is also a GitHub Actions workflow that will build the application statically and deploy it to GitHub Pages. You'll need to enable GitHub Pages in your repository.
